          # A context represents additional information included with user input or with
          # an intent returned by the Dialogflow API. Contexts are helpful for
          # differentiating user input which may be vague or have a different meaning
          # depending on additional details from your application such as user setting
          # and preferences, previous user input, where the user is in your application,
          # geographic location, and so on.
          #
          # You can include contexts as input parameters of a
          # [DetectIntent][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2beta1.Sessions.DetectIntent] (or
          # [StreamingDetectIntent][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2beta1.Sessions.StreamingDetectIntent]) request,
          # or as output contexts included in the returned intent.
          # Contexts expire when an intent is matched, after the number of `DetectIntent`
          # requests specified by the `lifespan_count` parameter, or after 10 minutes
          # if no intents are matched for a `DetectIntent` request.
          #
          # For more information about contexts, see the
          # [Dialogflow documentation](https://dialogflow.com/docs/contexts).
