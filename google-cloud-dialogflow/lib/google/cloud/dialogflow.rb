    # # Ruby Client for Dialogflow API ([Alpha](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby#versioning))
    #
    # [Dialogflow API][Product Documentation]:
    # An end-to-end development suite for conversational interfaces (e.g.,
    # chatbots, voice-powered apps and devices).

      module Agents
        ##
        # Agents are best described as Natural Language Understanding (NLU) modules
        # that transform user requests into actionable data. You can include agents
        # in your app, product, or service to determine user intent and respond to the
        # user in a natural way.
        #
        # After you create an agent, you can add {Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2beta1::Intents Intents}, {Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2beta1::Contexts Contexts},
        # {Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2beta1::EntityTypes Entity Types}, {Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2beta1::WebhookRequest Webhooks}, and so on to
        # manage the flow of a conversation and match user input to predefined intents
        # and actions.
        #
        # You can create an agent using both Dialogflow Standard Edition and
        # Dialogflow Enterprise Edition. For details, see
        # [Dialogflow Editions](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow-enterprise/docs/editions).
        #
        # You can save your agent for backup or versioning by exporting the agent by
        # using the {Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2beta1::Agents::ExportAgent ExportAgent} method. You can import a saved
        # agent by using the {Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2beta1::Agents::ImportAgent ImportAgent} method.
        #
        # Dialogflow provides several
        # [prebuilt agents](https://dialogflow.com/docs/prebuilt-agents) for common
        # conversation scenarios such as determining a date and time, converting
        # currency, and so on.
        #
        # For more information about agents, see the
        # [Dialogflow documentation](https://dialogflow.com/docs/agents).

      module EntityTypes
        ##
        # Entities are extracted from user input and represent parameters that are
        # meaningful to your application. For example, a date range, a proper name
        # such as a geographic location or landmark, and so on. Entities represent
        # actionable data for your application.
        #
        # When you define an entity, you can also include synonyms that all map to
        # that entity. For example, "soft drink", "soda", "pop", and so on.
        #
        # There are three types of entities:
        #
        # * **System** - entities that are defined by the Dialogflow API for common
        #   data types such as date, time, currency, and so on. A system entity is
        #   represented by the +EntityType+ type.
        #
        # * **Developer** - entities that are defined by you that represent
        #   actionable data that is meaningful to your application. For example,
        #   you could define a +pizza.sauce+ entity for red or white pizza sauce,
        #   a +pizza.cheese+ entity for the different types of cheese on a pizza,
        #   a +pizza.topping+ entity for different toppings, and so on. A developer
        #   entity is represented by the +EntityType+ type.
        #
        # * **User** - entities that are built for an individual user such as
        #   favorites, preferences, playlists, and so on. A user entity is
        #   represented by the {Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2beta1::SessionEntityType SessionEntityType} type.

      module Intents
        ##
        # An intent represents a mapping between input from a user and an action to
        # be taken by your application. When you pass user input to the
        # {Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2beta1::Sessions::DetectIntent DetectIntent} (or
        # {Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2beta1::Sessions::StreamingDetectIntent StreamingDetectIntent}) method, the
        # Dialogflow API analyzes the input and searches
        # for a matching intent. If no match is found, the Dialogflow API returns a
        # fallback intent (+is_fallback+ = true).
        #
        # You can provide additional information for the Dialogflow API to use to
        # match user input to an intent by adding the following to your intent.
        #
        # * **Contexts** - provide additional context for intent analysis. For
        #   example, if an intent is related to an object in your application that
        #   plays music, you can provide a context to determine when to match the
        #   intent if the user input is “turn it off”.  You can include a context
        #   that matches the intent when there is previous user input of
        #   "play music", and not when there is previous user input of
        #   "turn on the light".
        #
        # * **Events** - allow for matching an intent by using an event name
        #   instead of user input. Your application can provide an event name and
        #   related parameters to the Dialogflow API to match an intent. For
        #   example, when your application starts, you can send a welcome event
        #   with a user name parameter to the Dialogflow API to match an intent with
        #   a personalized welcome message for the user.
        #
        # * **Training phrases** - provide examples of user input to train the
        #   Dialogflow API agent to better match intents.
        #
        # For more information about intents, see the
        # [Dialogflow documentation](https://dialogflow.com/docs/intents).
